# Python-Info-Stealer
Some possibilitys to steal other peoples Info with Python :)

This Tool can grab:
-Mac Adresses
-Ip Adresses
-Installed Programms
-Computer Name
-OS
-Generic System and Processor Info
-Location


What you need to use it:
-Python installed on your PC
-A discord Server and Webhook for the webhook version
-The libraries listed in requirements.txt
-A tool like auto_py_to_exe to convert it into an .exe if you want to send the Programm to other People (Thats not legal btw)


The netifaces Module is needed to retrieve Mac Adresses could cause Problems, and uses much Storage, so i would recommend to you to delete the Mac Adress and netifaces Parts in the Code.
